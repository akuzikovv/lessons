/*
An exercise has a superclass - AbstractPerson and a couple subclasses: Student and Teacher. CollegeStudent is a
subclass of Student. A Teacher will be like AbstractPerson but will have additional properties such as salary (the
amount the teacher earns) and subject (e.g. "Computer Science", "Chemistry", "English", "Other"). The
CollegeStudent class will extend the Student class by adding a year (current level in college) and major
(e.g. "Electrical Engineering", "Communications", and â€œUndeclared"). The Student class is derived from
the AbstractPerson class and used as a starting point for the CollegeStudent class. Gender can be "M" for male
and "F" for female. Acronym GPA stands for Grade Point Average.
